# Firebase Auth and Firestore with React
This is a web application that allows authenticating users with React and Firebase as Backend. In this tutorial you will learn how to use Firebase Authentication, the Firebase service to register users with Email (Gmail), Facebook, Github, Twitter and More. I also learned how to create an application from scratch, connect it to firebase, create an interface with TailwindCSS, connect it with a NoSQL database with Firestore, and do user login and registration, in addition to the deployment in Vercel.
